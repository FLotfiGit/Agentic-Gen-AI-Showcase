# Agentic-Gen-AI-Showcase
A curated collection of experiments and frameworks exploring the intersection of **Agentic AI** and **Generative AI** — including reasoning-driven LLM agents, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multimodal synthesis, and autonomous decision-making systems.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository serves as a hands-on showcase of modern **agentic and generative intelligence**:
- **Agentic Reasoning:** Multi-step planning and goal-oriented agents.
- **Generative Modeling:** Text, image, and multimodal generation.
- **RAG & Tool Use:** Integrating retrieval, APIs, and dynamic memory.
- **Evaluation:** Benchmarking performance and reasoning quality.
